This is a demo that uses the API provided by giphy.com to access their gif images.

The initial layout contains pre-defined buttons, a search bar and submit button.

Pre-defined buttons display 10 related still gif images when clicked. Clicking on the images makes them toggle between still and animated gifs.

Enter topics into the search bar and click "Submit" to create your own buttons to access images related to your topics of choice.
